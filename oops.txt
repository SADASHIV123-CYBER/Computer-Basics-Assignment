Q.1 ---?
--> class Object {
    public int add(int n1, int n2) {
        int result  = n1 + n2;
        return result;
    }
}

public class opps {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = new Object();

        int result = obj.add(1, 2);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
    
}


can create object in java by using this meathod 

Q.2 ---?
--> in java we are using new keyword for create new object.

Q.3 ---?
--> we have three types of variable in java:
                                            1> local
                                            2> instance
                                            3> static

Q.4 ---?
--> the instance variable is declared inside the class but outside the meathod and the local variable is declared inside the meathod

Q.5 ---? 
--> instance variable -> heap memory
    local variable -> stack memory

Q.6 ---? 
--> in we have special feature of meathod overloading thats allows to class multiple meathod with same name but with different 
    parameaters.
