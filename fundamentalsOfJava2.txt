Q.1 ---?
--> statically typed programming languages check theri variable at compilation time but the Dynamically typed programming languages cheks 
    their variable at run time.

    statically typed programming languages: c, c++, java...
    Dynamically typed programming languages: javascript, python, pht...

Q.2 ---?
--> variables in java is the fundamental element, that can be stored data  manipulated throughout a program.

Q.3 ---?
--> assign a value to variable by using assignment operator(=).

Q.4 ---?
--> primitive data type in java predefined data type that cam be store symple value directly.

Q.5 ---?
--> In Java, identifiers are names given to elements in a program, such as variables, classes, methods, and objects. They are used to 
    identify and differentiate between different parts of the code.

Q.6 ---?
--> Types of Operators in Java:-
        Arithmetic Operators
        Unary Operators
        Assignment Operator
        Relational Operators
        Logical Operators
        Ternary Operator
        Bitwise Operators
        Shift Operators
        instance of operator

Q.7 ---?
--> in java we have uniary operator and in this operator we have increment(++) and decrement operator.
    1> increment(++): 

        this type of operator we are using for increment by one.
        in this type of operator we have two types: 

            1>pre increment: they are increment first and then assign the value

                example: public class asdf {
                            public static void main(String args[]) {
                                int a = 10;
                                int b = ++a;
                                System.out.println(a);
                                System.out.println(b);
                            }
                        }  
                            output: 11
                                    11

            2>post increment: they are assign the value and then increment the value

                example: public class asdf {

                            public static void main(String args[]) {
                                int a = 10;
                                int b = a++;
                                System.out.println(a);
                                System.out.println(b);
                            }
                        }
                            output: 11
                                    10

    2> decrement(--):

    this type of operator we are using for decrement by one.
    in this type of operator we hva two types:

        1>pre: in this type they are decrement first and then assign the value.
        
            example: public class asdf {

                        public static void main(String args[]) {
                            int a = 10;
                            int b = --a;
                            System.out.println(a);
                            System.out.println(b);
                        }
                    }  
                        output: 9
                                9

        2>post: in this type they are assign the value and then decrement the value.

            example: public class asdf {
                        public static void main(String args[]) {
                            int a = 10;
                            int b = a--;
                            System.out.println(a);
                            System.out.println(b);
                        }
                    }
                        output: 9
                                10
